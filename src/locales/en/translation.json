During this period, the team developed its own approach to flow orchestration and optimization of integrations with external services (credit bureaus, fraud detection, scoring engines). This approach later became the foundation of the ZIC product — Zardan Integration Core.",

      "p2": "Our processes emphasize auditability, accountability, and control. Documentation, monitoring, and performance baselines are established for every solution deployed.",
      "p3": "Zardan Systems operates under principles of precision, verification, and reliability — ensuring that each delivered system enhances operational integrity and long-term scalability."

      "p1": "The company provides services primarily across the European Union and the United Kingdom, with strong focus on Central and Eastern European markets since 2021. Our key directions include Polish digital credit platforms requiring integration with BIK, AntiFraud, and complex fan-in/fan-out processes, as well as Ukrainian MFIs working with UBKI, PVBKI, internal AntiFraud systems, and unstable adapters.",
      "p2": "We also deliver integration projects in adjacent sectors including logistics, ERP systems, and event-driven systems for GPS and delivery services. Our development continues to focus on strengthening cooperation with European financial sectors through standardized integration frameworks and the ZIC product, which brings enterprise integration practices to fast lending environments."
